# LAB 33 - Custom Hooks

**To Do List Manager Phase 3:**  Adding some configuration settings to the application.

In this phase, we’ll be adding some top-level settings for the application, so that the user can make some display choices that the app will use by default.

## Phase 3 Requirements

In Phase 3, we’d like to extend the functionality of the application by potentially allowing users to set a few configuration options to change how the application behaves. 

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I would like to see my To Do List Items a few at a time so that I don’t have to wade through them all
- As a user, I would like my default view to only be “Incomplete” Items so that I can quickly determine what I have to do
- As a user, I would like my list sorted by difficulty so that I can more easily prioritize
- As a user, I would like the option to change my default preferences with regards to how many Items I see per page, which items are filtered, and how they are sorted
