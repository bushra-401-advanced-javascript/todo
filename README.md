# LAB 34 - Login & Auth

**To Do List Manager Phase 3:**  Adding security and access controls to the application.

In this phase, we’ll be requiring that users be logged in, in order to see the to do items. Additionally, based on their user type, they will be allowed (or denied) to perform actions such as editing or deleting them.

## Phase 3 Requirements

In Phase 4, we’d like to extend the functionality of the application by requiring users be logged in to view items and also restrict access based on user type. 

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I want to provide a way for other users to create new accounts
- As a user, I want to provide a way for all users to login to their account
- As a user, I want to make sure that my To Do items are only viewable to users that have logged in with a valid account.
- As a user, I want to ensure that only fellow users that are allowed to “create”, based on their user type, can add new To Do Items
- As a user, I want to ensure that only fellow users that are allowed to “update”, based on their user type, can mark To Do Items complete
- As a user, I want to ensure that only fellow users that are allowed to “delete”, based on their user type, can delete new To Do Items
