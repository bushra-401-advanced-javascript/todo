# LAB 32 - Custom Hooks

**To Do List Manager Phase 2:**  Connecting the To Do Application to an external API and Database.

In this phase, we’ll be connecting our application to an API so that our list will be saved permanently. This will require a working and deployed API server with a proper “To Do” data model and appropriate REST routes.

## Phase 2 Requirements

In Phase 2, we’re going to connect the To Do Manager to a backend system, using the API server that we have previously built.

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I would like to be able to add, update, and delete To Do items
- As a user, I would like my To Do Items to be permanently stored so that I can re-access them at any time, using any device
